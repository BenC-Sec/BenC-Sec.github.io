Beginning the ongoing process of identifying and assessing threats to the business.

You can find the first part of this series here: <a href="/initial tlr lan/">Initial Threat Landscape Report: Part 1 - Language </a>

## Where to start?

## The General threat environment

Identifying general threats that need to be communicated to stakeholders in the TLR.

I recommend beginning with a review of Government and trusted private sector reporting. See the <a href="/resources/">resources </a>section for some possible sources.

<h3 style="color: #CCCCCC; text-decoration: underline;">Identify Threat Actor Classifications</h3>

The industry tends to group threat actors based on shared characteristics. This includes their motivations, organizational structure, capabilities, and available resources.

Example:

<a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2024">ENISA's Threat Landscape report </a> identifies the following key threat actor categories. <br> Note: I have added in brackets alternative names often seen for each classification.

* State-nexus (Advanced Persistent Threats- APTs)
* Criminal (Organised Criminal Networks, OCNs / Organised Criminal groups OCGs)
* Private sector
* Hactivists

For an intitial TLR I would recommend limiting the classifications to no more than 3 or 4. The objective at this stage is to provide a broad overview of the threat landscape, excessive detail may hinder understanding.

<h3 style="color: #CCCCCC; text-decoration: underline;">Understand Each Threat Actor Classification – Motives and Capabilities</h3>

How to choose which threat actor classifications to include in the TLR? You need to understand their motives and capabilities.

Example:

The <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Cyber%20crime%20-%20understabnding%20the%20online%20business%20model.pdf">NCSC </a>  has a simple breakdown of the OCN ecosystem. 

<a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/cms/sites/default/files/documents/EU-SOCTA-2025.pdf">EUROPOL </a> has produced a detailed report on focused on OCN activity in the EU.

From these it can be seen that OCNs are:

* Motivated primarilly by financial gain
* Have medium to high organisation levels
* Have medium to high resources and capabilities

OCNs are therefore certainly a likely threat to any business. 

During your research, you will identify classifications that will share motivational or capability characteristics and these could be grouped together at this stage.

Example:

While Script Kiddies and Hacktivists have distinct motivations, they share similarities in their capabilities.

<h3 style="color: #CCCCCC; text-decoration: underline;">Identify Key Trends in the Cyber Environment</h3>

With an understanding of the different types of threat actors, examine a broad range of reports to identify emerging trends.

Example:

Reviewing multiple industry sources, some key trends in 2024 / early 2025 are apparent.

<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/intelligence-reports/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2024">Microsoft Digital Defence Report 2024</a> reports: 
* Blurring of the lines between nation state and criminal activity
* Increasing number of Identity attacks, primarily password attacks

<a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/research/2025-incident-response-report">Palo Alto's Global Incident Response Report 2025</a> reports: 

* Increasing number and sophistication of software supply chain and cloud attacks 
* Increasing Identity Access Management issues
* Increasing Insider risk

<a href="https://www.cve.org/about/Metrics">MITRE's CVE Program</a> reports:

* Increaseing number of reported vulnerabilites in 2024 

By reviewing a wide range of trusted sources and applying sound analytical methods, you can build a more reliable and comprehensive picture of the threat environment

The next part, <a href='/initial tlr CST/'>Initial Threat Landscape Report: Part 3 – Converging on Specific Threats</a>, continues the iterative process of identifying threats to the organization and begins narrowing the focus to those most relevant to your specific environment.
