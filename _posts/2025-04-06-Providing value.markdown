As Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Analysts, we produce a range of intelligence products tailored to diverse stakeholders. Each requires their own approach. 

When aiming to inform key decision makers with strategic intelligence, we need to speak their language. They focus on achieving business objectives and are not necessary technically minded.

I've found that an initial threat landscape report (TLR) serves as an effective starting point. If done correctly, it presents key cyber issues in business relevant language opening the door for meaningful dialogue. 

A TLR enables the CTI team to begin understanding stakeholder requirements, identifying business intelligence gaps and defining success. At the same time, key decision makers begin to view cyber risk through a business lens. This increases their willingness to support and collaborate with the CTI team as a strategic partner.
