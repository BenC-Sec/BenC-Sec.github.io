Welcome to CTI in practice.

I'm Ben and this site is dedicated to the practical implementation of CTI.  

This section (<a href="/">Delivery</a>) specifically focuses on the successful delivery of products and assumes no CTI program is in place. However, by following the guidance provided, you will effectively be building one.

I provide practical guidance on creating deliverables. While I will point you to useful resources, I wonâ€™t be explaining in depth textbook concepts, this site is where theory meets practice.

For walk throughs to CTI collection see <a href="/collection/">Collection </a>

For guides setting up basic CTI tools including MISP and OpenCTI see <a href="/setup/">Setup Guides </a>

For resources that I've found useful see <a href="/resources/">Resources </a>

If you'd like to know a little more about me see the <a href="/about/">about </a> section

Let's begin and delivery starts with an introduction to <a href="/providing value/">Providing Business Value </a>
