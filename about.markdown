Hi, I'm Ben. I'm thrilled to have you here! With over a decade of experience working across intelligence disciplines I've found that much of the guidance is often theoretical, without clear direction on how to apply it in day-to-day activities. Additionally, many common tools assume a level of technical knowledge that can make it difficult for entry-level analysts to dive in and start using them effectively. This blog focuses on CTI and is a place to share insights, experiences, and lessons learned. My goal is to provide clear practical guidance to help you effectively implement CTI in your daily work.
