Hi, I'm Ben. I'm thrilled to have you here! With over a decade of experience working across intelligence disciplines I've found that much of the guidance is often theoretical, without clear direction on how to apply it to daily activities. Additionally, many common tools assume a level of technical knowledge that can make it difficult for entry-level analysts to dive in and start using them effectively. 

My goal is to provide clear, practical guidance to help you learn, understand, and effectively apply Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI).

I'm continually adding content as I have the time!
